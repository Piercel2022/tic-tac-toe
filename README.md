<!-- Features -->

### Key Feature <a name="key-features"></a>


-  1: Grid: The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which consists of a total of nine cells.
-  2: Players: Tic-tac-toe is a two-player game. One player takes the role of 'X,' and the other player takes the role of 'O.'
-  3: Turns: The players take turns making their moves. The game always starts with the player using 'X.'
-  4: Markings: Each player's goal is to mark three consecutive cells in a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). Players take 
          turns placing their marks in empty cells.
-  5: Win condition: The game ends when one player successfully gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The player who achieves 
          this wins the game.
-  6: Draw condition: If all the cells on the grid are filled, and no player has achieved a winning combination, the game is declared a draw or 
         a tie.
-  7: Strategies: Tic-tac-toe is a game with perfect information, meaning that there is no randomness involved, and all the information is 
         available to both players. With optimal play from both sides, the game will always end in a draw.
-  8: Simplicity: Tic-tac-toe is a straightforward game that is easy to learn and understand, making it suitable for players of all ages.
